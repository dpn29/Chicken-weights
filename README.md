# Chicken-weights

2nd year Maths undergraduate Statistics course at Cambridge, Question 12 from Example Sheet 3 in 2020.


Compute a 95% confidence set for the vector of mean chick weights for the different food supplements in the chickwts data set (one of the in-built data sets in R). Now compute 95% confidence intervals for
each of the individual mean chick weights. Which intervals exclude the estimate of the overall mean chick weight in the null model which assumes that the mean chick weight does not
depend on the food supplement?
